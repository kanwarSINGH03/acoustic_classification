# ðŸ§  Acoustic Roof Sound Classification

This project classifies underground mine roof sounds (e.g., **drummy** vs **tight**) using MFCC-based features extracted from real impact recordings. The model uses an MLP trained on labeled audio samples from Saskatchewan potash mines.

## Torchaudio MFCC transform
- **sample_rate=48000**: The audio is sampled at 48 kHz.
- **n_fft=2048**: Each FFT window spans 2048 samples (~42.7ms).
- **hop_length=512**: The window moves 512 samples (~10.7ms) each time.
- **n_mels=128**: The Mel-scaled frequency bins are used.
- **n_mfcc=40**: The top 40 cepstral coefficients are retained.

Each 0.75-second waveform (36,000 samples) is processed into:
- An MFCC tensor of shape `[1, 40 , ~71]`.
- Flattened into a vector of shape `[2840]` for input into the MLP.

## Dataset

| Split | Samples | Description                           |
|-------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| Train | 3000    | Recorded roof impact sounds (labeled) |
| Test  | 309     | Held out for final evaluation         |

- **Label `0`** = drummy  
- **Label `1`** = tight

## Accuracy
Accuracy on Test Set of 309 items was **94%**

## Model: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

I used a simple 2-layer MLP to classify the acoustic signals, 1 hidden layer with 512 neurons
- **Optimizer - Adam**
- **Loss - CE Loss with 2 final features**
- **LR = 0.0001**
- **Epochs = 10**
