abstract = {The stability of underground mine roofs is critical to the safety of miners. They often assess the condition of the roof by striking it with a long bar and then interpret the sound of the impact as either “tight” (safe) or “drummy” (unsafe). This paper presents a dataset of a 3309 acoustic recordings of such impacts, labelled as by an expert miner as either drummy or tight. Data was recorded from a number of sites within 5 different underground mines, all potash mines in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.}
